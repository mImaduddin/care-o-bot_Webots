# care-o-bot_Webots

The project aims to develop a collaborative robotic system using Robotino (a mobile robot) and Ned (a stationary robot arm) within a simulated home setting created in Webots. The goal is to program these robots to interact with each other and assist an elderly resident by performing tasks like delivering a glass of water and aiding in drinking.
Our team will utilize Webots for 3D modeling and simulation, alongside Python for programming the robot's behaviors and interactions.



Work in Progress:  3DOF Inverse Kinematics solution and Gradient Descent Inverse Kinematics (see GD_Ned_V1.1.0.py)

Outlook: Implement LIDAR-based SLAM on Robotino.
